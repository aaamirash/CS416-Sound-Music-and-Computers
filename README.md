Week 1/2: 
  Clipped: Produced a soundwave using sine wave formula and then created a clipped version
  at a specified magnitude.

Week 2/3:
   Chord builder: A personal small project playing around with stacking notes in an array
   and building chords. After 4 notes there is way too much noise for it to be enjoyable to
   listen to.

Week 6/7:
  Adaptive tone control: This program takes a wav file and measures the energy in different 
  frequency ranges and adjusts the different ranges energy to be more balanced. This creates
  a more balanced tonal sound in the audio file.

Week 9/10:
  Popgen2.0: I took Bart's pop song generator and added a few things onto it. I added an envelop
  to reduce the popping sound between pitches. I added one alternate chord progression that gets
  randomly selected. I added 3/4 time that gets randomly selected. I also added a clamp to the 
  melody so it doesn't go too high or too low.

Week 10:
  Course Project: This program determines the vocal range you are singing in live. It stores the frequencies aka pitches and then determines where your voice lies. It has some simple logic to determine the voice part you would have in a traditional 4 part choir (AKA SATB). The program then asks if you want to hear what you just sang either pitched up or down. Right now I have a hard coded to 7 half step, which moves the recording up or down a fifth.
