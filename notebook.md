10/15: Played around with more frequency creation. Figured out how to build a chord with a python program. It involved storing different frequencies in an array and having a loop iterate over it, adding each one to the sound being played. 

10/18: Attempting to get a grasp on fourier and dft's.

10/24: Learned about different filtration. Different forms of "pass" filters means 
that different ranges of frequencies are filtered out of a sound. For example, low pass means that only certain low frequencies
don't get filtered out of a sound.

10/29: Playing around with creating a python program that plays a canon but running into issues with having multiple lines 
play at the same time. I might look into multithreading.
