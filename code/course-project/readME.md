Voice Part/ Vocal Range Analyzer:
This program determines the vocal range you are singing in live
stores the frequencies aka pitches and then determines where your voice
lies. It has some simple logic to determine the voice part you would have in a 
traditional 4 part choir (AKA SATB).
The program then asks if you want to hear what you just sang either
pitched up or down. Right now I have a hard coded to 7 half step,
which moves the recording up or down a fifth.
